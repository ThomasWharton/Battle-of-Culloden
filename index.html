                <p>The Battle of Culloden was the final battle of the Jacobite uprising of 1745. The Jacobites were lead by Charles Edward Stuart (also known as Bonny Prince Charlie) and aimed to overthrow the current British goverment, restoring House Stuart as the ruling monarchy. The Jacobites would suffer a devastating loss at the hands of the British goverment and would ultimately spell the end of the rebellion.</p>
