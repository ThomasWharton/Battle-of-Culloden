## Design Choices
---

### Fonts

To add more character to the site, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") was used to select 3 fonts to be used across the site. For the page logo, [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel/ "Cinzel") was used as this fits the "history" aesthetic of the site and catches the eye of the user to create an immediate interest. For headers and navigation links, [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display "Playfair Display") was selected to make them stand out from the main text, it also blends well with theme of the site. Lastly, for the main text, [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans "Noto Sans") was used as this compliments the other fonts, as well as being easy to read.

### Icons

Icons were selected from the website [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons are used to represent the navigation element on smaller screens and for social media links in the footer.

### Colours

The initial colour (demin) was selected due to it being the blue colour in the Scottish flag and would therefore fit the theme of Scottish history. The hexcode for demin was found using the website [Flag Color Codes](https://www.flagcolorcodes.com/scotland "Flag Color Codes"). [Coolors](http://coolors.co "Coolors") was then used to create the colour palette for the website with the first selection of denim being locked in and the rest of the palette following suite. 

The colours and their uses are listed below.

* #005EB8 - This colour will be used for the header and footer elements as well as borders for table and list elements. 
* #009CFC - This colour will be used as a background colour for sections and elements, as well as for text.
* #0076AC - This colour will be used for the booking form background.
* #878E8D - This colour will be used for a small amount of text.
* #FFFFFF - This colour will be used as a background colour for sections and elements, as well as for text.

### Structure

The site will be built with mobile first mindset with the Samsung Galaxy S8+ (360px) being the smallest screen size for styling of site. Using [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap breakpoints"), screen size breakpoints will be selected for media queries to add optimised styling for different viewing purposes. The break points are shown below.

| Screen Size | Breakpoint|
| ------------|-----------|
| x-small     | <576px    |
| small       | => 576px  |
| medium      | => 768px  |
| large       | => 992px  |

## Wireframes
---

Wireframes have been developed to give a general structure and layout to the site on various device sizes. The wireframes were created using [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com. "Balsamic"). The first wireframe was created with mobile screen size in mind and scaled up to tablet and desktop sizes. A one-page website is used to allow the user to quickly access all content available. This is especially true for mobile users who will be scrolling down continuously, rather than navigating through different pages. 

The wireframes are linked below:
