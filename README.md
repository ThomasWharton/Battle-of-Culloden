For the page logo, [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel/ "Cinzel") was used as this fits the "history" aesthetic of the site and catches the eye of the user to create an immediate interest. For headers and navigation links, [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display "Playfair Display") was selected to make them stand out from the main text, it also blends well with theme of the site. Lastly, for the main text, [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway "Raleway") was used as this compliments the other fonts, as well as being easy to read.
